Welcome to the SensiTrain Project Annotation Dashboard!

The SensiTrain Project aims to annotate potentially offensive parts of online interactions from popular social media platform Reddit. Our goal is to identify communication that may be offensive to a particular group of people. Your annotations will contribute to training a model for improved understanding and detection.

Instructions:

Please follow these steps for annotation:

1. Watch the tutorial video: Before you begin, we recommend watching the tutorial video that demonstrates the annotation process. It provides a clear overview of how to annotate offensive content effectively. You can find the tutorial video by clicking the "View Tutorial" button.

2. Review the post: Start by reviewing the post carefully. If everything appears fine and there is no offensive content, simply skip to the next post using the provided navigation.

3. Annotate offensive content: To annotate offensive content, click on the tag that represents the specific type of offense. Then, click and hold the mouse button to drag and highlight the part of the text or image that you believe is offensive.

4. Add an explanation: After highlighting the offensive content, provide an explanation in the designated field on the right side. Explain why you consider the highlighted part to be potentially offensive. Be as detailed as possible to provide valuable insights for training the model.

5. Submit and proceed: Once you have completed the annotation for a post, click the submit button to move on to the next post in the queue.
